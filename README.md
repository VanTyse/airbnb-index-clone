# Airbnb Clone

I worked on this as a practical test for a dope Lagos company. And even if I don't land the role, I am really glad that I worked on it. 
First of all, you may want to open this app on a windows. There is a problem that still needs to be solved as the application doesnt load on safari and other webkit browsers.

## Components

So all the components you can find in the application were custom. There was a time limit so they are not as abstracted as I would like but if you want to create a slider or a calendar, you should definitely check the code out under the components folder.

Please drop a star if you like.
